# :hammer: PROMISES :question:

- `Explanation:`:
  
Promises are a feature in JavaScript that allow you to handle asynchronous operations more easily and in a more organized manner. They avoid "callback hell" and provide a cleaner and more readable way to work with asynchronous code.

Promises provides too a better way to handle errors with the catch function and rejection method.

It's possible to have paralel operations with promises too, using promise.all, reace and so on methods...
